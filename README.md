# Data set description 

pgaTourData.csv contains ... rows and ...columns. Each row indicates a golfer's performance for that year.

- Player Name: Name of the golfer
- Rounds: The number of games that a player played
- Fairway Percentage: The percentage of time a tee shot lands on the fairway
- Year: The year in which the statistic was collected
- Avg Distance: The average distance of the tee-shot
- Green in Regulation: is met if any part of the ball is touching the putting surface while the number of strokes taken is at least two fewer than par
- Average Putts: The average number of strokes taken on the green
- Average Scrambling: Scrambling is when a player misses the green in regulation, but still makes par or better on a hole
- Average Score: Average Score is the average of all the scores a player has played in that year
- Points: The number of FedExCup points a player earned in that year. These points can be earned by competing in tournaments.
- Wins: The number of competition a player has won in that year
- Top 10: The number of competitions where a player has placed in the Top 10
- Average SG Putts: Strokes gained: putting measures how many strokes a   player gains (or loses) on the greens.
- Average SG Total: The Off-the-tee + approach-the-green + around-the-green + putting statistics combined
- SG:OTT: Strokes gained: off-the-tee measures player performance off the tee on all par-4s and par-5s.
- SG:APR: Strokes gained: approach-the-green measures player performance on approach shots. Approach shots include all shots that are not from the tee on par-4 and par-5 holes and are not included in strokes gained: around-the-green and strokes gained: putting. Approach shots include tee shots on par-3s.
- SG:ARG: Strokes gained: around-the-green measures player performance on any shot within 30 yards of the edge of the green. This statistic does not include any shots taken on the putting green.

# Project


I started by web scrapping 9 different pages of the  official PGA Tour website (https://www.pgatour.com/) which provides all sorts of data for all major golf tournaments. The website provides plentty of historical and I took this opportunity in order to go back to 2012 and start building the data frame that I wanted from the FedEx Cup Tournament. In order to do so, I built a way to extract all the data that I needed for my study for each year and repeated the same process for all years from 2012 to 2021 and stored all those dataframes into a folder called data.

Next, I joined all the dataframes into a single one and I began to clean it. First I had to change all data types from strings to float numbers and to do so I had to clean almost every column from empty spaces and get rid of all commmas. Once that had been done, I made sure that there werenÂ´t any empty spaces left and from there I started creating some columns which I believed were going to be usefull for my future analysis. (SCORE_AVERAGE, DRIVING_DISTANCE, DRIVING_ACCURACY, DRIVING USAGE, GREENS_IN_REGULATION%, SG_PUTTING and SG_TOTAL). I dropped the columns which I no longer needed and I saved that dataframe for future analysis.

I decided to do a general visual analylis to get a look at the most valuable skills in golf are (in my opinion)
