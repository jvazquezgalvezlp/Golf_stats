# Purpose of project

I want to get top 25 pro golfers in each separate type of shot withing the game (Driving, approaching, chipping and putting) for years 2017 and 2018, make a new column that will rank them, and compare that ranking to next yearÂ´s lowest scoring averages, that will be obtained from the pgatour/stats web.
